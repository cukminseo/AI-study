## Past Activities
- Studied Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
- Read "Introduction to Machine Learning with Python" by Andreas C. Muller.
	- Studied supervised-learning theory.
	- Implemented KNN algorithm.
	- Classified the Iris dataset.
	- Implemented Linear Regression.
- Explored L1 and L2 norms.
- Studied linear algebra with numpy.linalg.
- Implemented gradient descent.
- Learned about perceptrons and multi-layer perceptrons.
- Delved into CNN theory.
- Explored activation functions:
	- Sigmoid
	- ReLU
	- Tanh
	- Softmax
- Worked with MNIST for forward-propagation.
- Began learning PyTorch and its module, torch.nn.
- Studied forward and backward propagation.
- Explored the architecture of AlexNet.

## Ongoing Activities
- Transferring content from another repository(only markdown, private) to the current repository (using Obsidian).
- Studying VGG architecture.

## Upcoming Activities
- Planning to study ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet, and InceptionNet architectures.
